# spacexiss-autodocker
Makeshift autopilot for SpaceX ISS docking simulator, right from the Kerbal Research Labs.

# Usage:

- start docking simulator https://iss-sim.spacex.com/
- open developer console
- paste dock.js content to javascript console
- wait

# Issues:
- it uses too much RCS propellant (who cares tho, it's in infinite supply!)
- it's painfully careful which makes docking too slow, eps at the final 5-10 meters

# License

Please don't run it on real Dragon hardware.
